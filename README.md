## CS 465 - Full Stack Development I

**Architecture**

With this project, JavaScript, SPA and Express HTML are used. The websiteâ€™s initial version used Express. As seen during implementation, it had no ability to talk to a database due to how static Express is. With SPA and JavaScript, we created a website that is dynamic, allowing us to use MongoDB. No-SQL is a strong choice in this stack due to its schema flexibility and allows for scale.

**Functionality**

JSON was used within JavaScript objects, storing and calling based on the needs of the fronted. For refactoring, I wrote an array which held trip information, then swapped hard coding to writing functions to pull dynamic objects.

**Testing**

Endpoint provides visibility for what is functioning. Testing primarily is dependent on the endpoint type. Looking at an endpoint that pulls information via the database, testing for information and making sure that is the only data being pulled would be a suitable test. An easy test within functionality would be creating a server you have locally and pass the page. Developers can test as if it was a live web application.

**Reflection**

Within the course, I was given challenges to put together my understanding of software development and obtain new skills. Using new tools and techniques, it continued to expose me to think about software engineering more deeply and think about the problems I needed to solve. I believe the exercise of using new tools and deep diving technologies that I was already familiar with will assist in my future goals.
